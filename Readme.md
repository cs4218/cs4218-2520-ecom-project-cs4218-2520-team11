## 4. Setting Up The Project

### 1. Installing Node.js

1. **Download and Install Node.js**:
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to download and install Node.js.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal and check the installed versions of Node.js and npm:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

### 2. MongoDB Setup (Local Docker)

We use Docker to run MongoDB locally. This ensures all developers have an identical database environment.

1. **Install Docker Desktop**:
   - Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your operating system.

2. **Verify Docker is Running**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

### 3. Application Setup

To download and use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) app from GitHub, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Go to the GitHub repository of the MERN app.
   - Click on the "Code" button and copy the URL of the repository.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Navigate into the cloned directory.

2. **Install Frontend and Backend Dependencies**
   - Run the following command in your project's root directory:

     ```bash
     npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..
     ```

3. **Start MongoDB and Seed Database**

   ```bash
   npm run db:start    # Start MongoDB container
   npm run db:seed     # Import sample data
   ```

   if anything goes wrong and you need to reset the database (revert back to seed data)

   ```bash
   npm run db:reset
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

### Database Management Commands

| Command             | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run db:start`  | Start MongoDB container                              |
| `npm run db:stop`   | Stop MongoDB container                               |
| `npm run db:seed`   | Import/refresh seed data                             |
| `npm run db:reset`  | Reset database (stop, delete data, restart, re-seed) |
| `npm run db:logs`   | View MongoDB logs                                    |
| `npm run db:status` | Check container status                               |

### Connecting with MongoDB Compass (Optional)

If you want to browse the database visually, on MongoDB Compass navigate to:
`mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin`

## 5. Unit Testing with Jest

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development aimed at verifying the functionality of individual units or components of a software application. It involves isolating these units and subjecting them to various test scenarios to ensure their correctness.  
Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework widely used for unit testing. It offers a simple and efficient way to write and execute tests in JavaScript projects.

### Getting Started with Jest

To begin unit testing with Jest in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jest**:  
   Use your preferred package manager to install Jest. For instance, with npm:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest

   ```

2. **Write Tests**  
   Create test files for your components or units where you define test cases to evaluate their behaviour.

3. **Run Tests**  
   Execute your tests using Jest to ensure that your components meet the expected behaviour.  
   You can run the tests by using the following command in the root of the directory:
   - **Frontend tests**

     ```bash
     npm run test:frontend
     ```

   - **Backend tests**

     ```bash
     npm run test:backend
     ```

   - **All the tests**
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```
